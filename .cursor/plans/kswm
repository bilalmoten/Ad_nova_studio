Here are three test scenarios designed to exercise the different capabilities of your new studio workflow (Visual Styles, Notes, Scenes, etc.).

Option 1: The "Visual Style" Stress Test (Sci-Fi Product)
This tests if the AI respects the specific "Visual Style" field and if the "Neon" aesthetic carries through from Concept -> Storyboard -> Video.

Project Name: Volt Pulse Energy
Description: A high-energy commercial for a new futuristic energy drink called "Volt Pulse". The video should show the drink glowing in a dark city, people gaming, and cybernetics.
Visual Style: Cyberpunk, Neon Noir, High Contrast, Glitch effects, Purple and Cyan palette, 80s Synthwave aesthetic.
Notes: The liquid inside the can must glow. Fast cuts. No slow motion.
Duration: 15 seconds / 5 shots
Option 2: The "Storyline" Flow Test (Cinematic Travel)
This tests the narrative generation. We want to see if the Storyline generator creates a logical sequence (waking up -> traveling -> arriving) based on the description.

Project Name: Escape to The Alps
Description: A luxury travel ad for a winter resort in the Swiss Alps. We follow a couple escaping the busy city to find peace in the mountains.
Visual Style: National Geographic style, majestic wide shots, warm sunlight on snow, cozy interior lighting, slow & peaceful camera movements.
Notes: Start with stressful city sounds, then transition to silence of the mountains. Focus on the feeling of relief.
Duration: 30 seconds / 6 shots.
Option 3: The "Context" Test (Abstract/Conceptual)
This tests if the "Notes" field effectively steers the AI away from generic stock footage tropes.

Project Name: Mindful AI
Description: An abstract commercial for an AI meditation app. Instead of showing people on phones, show abstract representations of peace and organized thoughts.
Visual Style: Minimalist 3D render, soft pastel colors, floating geometric shapes, glass textures, dreamlike.
Notes: Do NOT show any smartphones or technology devices. Focus entirely on abstract geometry calming down.
Duration: 15 seconds / 4 shots.
Recommended Test Path:

Create Project: Use Option 1 to see the strongest visual impact.
Concepts: See if the concepts suggest "Cyberpunk" themes.
Studio:
Generate the Storyline.
Go to Timeline View.
Edit a Scene: Change the description of Shot 2 manually.
Regenerate Visuals: Click the "Image" button on Shot 2 to see if it generates consistent cyberpunk style images.
Generate Video: Try generating the video for that shot.
